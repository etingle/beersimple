# P4 - BeerSimple Beer Rating App

##Live URL
<http://p4.evantingle.com/>

##Description

A Laravel application that allows users to look up and rate beers. BeerSimple contains a large database of beers and is seeded with fake users, ratings, and reviews. The p4 database uses 3 tables: Users, Beers, and Ratings.

Un-authenticated users can view the beer data, but not individual ratings. Once signed up and logged in, users are able to see the ratings and reviews submitted by other users. When a user creates, updates, or deletes their rating, the app will update the average rating and the number of reviews for each beer.

##Details for Teaching Team

I used Python scripts to scrape information from a beer website and to generate the seed data for the beer database.
